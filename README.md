## API and Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This __must__ be properly formatted. An example is below:

```json
{
    "records": [
        {
            "id": "rectn1q26eF5AMNBw",
            "fields": {

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Be able to create in each desination.
- Render data on page.
- Use external links to goto other websites relevent to quotes.
- 

#### PostMVP  

- Allow user to choose favorites 
- Be able to let User create and choose where to send it.
- 

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations. Here's an example.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|July 10-12| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete
|July 13| Project Approval | Incomplete
|July 13| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|July 14| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|July 15| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|July 16| MVP | Incomplete
|July 17| Presentations | Incomplete

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all parts of your app.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.
